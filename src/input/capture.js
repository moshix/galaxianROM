/**
 * Working out which control the player just moved.
 *
 * The remapping screen says "press the control for LEFT" and then has to answer
 * a surprisingly awkward question: out of maybe six axes and sixteen buttons,
 * all reporting numbers continuously, which one did the player mean?
 *
 * Reading the largest value does not work. A no-name stick's unused second axis
 * may sit at 0.4 forever, and an analogue trigger nobody is touching reports
 * -1.0 -- the largest magnitude on the device. Either would win every time and
 * the player could never bind anything else.
 *
 * So capture works the same way play does: rest is sampled the instant the
 * prompt appears, and controls are ranked by how far they have moved *since
 * then*. Two things fall out of that for free:
 *
 *  - An axis that idles off-centre contributes zero, however extreme it reads.
 *  - A button still held down from binding the previous row is part of rest, so
 *    it cannot be captured again. There is no "wait for release" state to get
 *    wrong, and no timer.
 *
 * Two guards on top. The capture threshold is higher than the play deadzone, so
 * a drifting axis cannot be bound by accident while a button is being pressed;
 * and a candidate has to win several frames running, because cheap analogue
 * hardware spikes for a frame at a time.
