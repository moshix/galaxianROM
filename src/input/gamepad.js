/**
 * Reading a USB joystick, once per frame.
 *
 * The Gamepad API has no events for the thing you actually want. `gamepad-
 * connected` fires once and `gamepaddisconnected` once, and in between there is
 * nothing at all -- no buttondown, no axischange. You call
 * `navigator.getGamepads()` and it hands back a fresh snapshot of every device.
 * So this is polled, and the poll goes in `stepFrame` immediately before
 * `nmi()`, next to where the self-playing AI decides: the same reasoning
 * applies, which is that whatever is going to close a switch this frame has to
 * do it before the machine samples its ports.
 *
 * Two consequences of polling, both handled elsewhere but worth stating here:
 *
 *  - The poll asserts the stick's *whole* state every frame, including all the
 *    controls that are not being used. It therefore cannot write `setInput`
 *    directly without stamping on the keyboard, and goes through the mux.
 *    @see src/input/mux.js
 *  - Nothing is reported until the player touches the device. Chrome will not
 *    even admit a pad exists until a button is pressed on it, which is a
 *    privacy measure against fingerprinting, so "no gamepad detected" is the
 *    honest state right up until the first press.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CANNOT DO: unlock the sound. Browsers require a "user activation"
 * gesture before a page may make noise, and gamepad input does not count -- only
 * keys, clicks and touches do. Calling `sound.start()` from here would produce a
 * rejected promise sixty times a second and no audio, so it is not called. The
 * keyboard covers it: coin and start are on 5 and 1 by design, and opening the
 * remapping screen is a keypress too.
 *
 * `navigator` is injected rather than reached for, so the whole class can be
 * driven from a test with no browser anywhere in sight.
