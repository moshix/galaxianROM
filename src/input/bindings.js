/**
 * What a joystick control *means*, and how to tell when it is being used.
 *
 * The Gamepad API only promises a fixed layout when it says so: a pad reporting
 * `mapping: "standard"` has the buttons and axes where you expect. A no-name
 * USB stick usually reports `mapping: ""` and numbers its axes and buttons
 * however its firmware felt like, which is why this file exists and why the
 * game ships a remapping screen instead of a table of magic indices.
 *
 * THE ONE IDEA WORTH INTERNALISING: a control is active when it has moved away
 * from where it *rests*, not when its value is large. Cheap sticks do not
 * centre at zero -- a worn potentiometer idles at 0.2 or 0.3 -- and analogue
 * triggers conventionally rest at -1.0 and travel to +1.0, so a trigger sitting
 * completely untouched reports the most extreme value the API can express. Test
 * the absolute value and such a stick reads as "hard left, forever". Test the
 * deviation from a rest value sampled while nobody was touching it and both
 * cases come out right, with no special-casing per device.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function of plain data, so the whole model is
 * exercised in plain Node with no browser (test/unit/input-bindings.test.mjs).
 * The storage helpers take a Storage-like object rather than reaching for
 * `localStorage` for the same reason.

 * would open and close the switch every frame, and because the swarm reads the
 * port once per frame that reads on screen as the ship vibrating rather than
 * moving. Digital hats slam between 0 and +-1 and never notice the gap.

 * everywhere -- with 1 and 2 included because plenty of sticks do not start

 *
 * Note what is deliberately absent: the hat-as-one-axis encoding some adapters
