/**
 * Merging two input sources onto one set of switches.
 *
 * The board has no notion of *who* closed a switch, and neither does
 * `Machine.setInput` -- it just sets or clears a port bit. That is fine while
 * the keyboard is the only input, because a key event is an *edge*: keydown
 * closes the switch, keyup opens it, and nothing ever re-asserts a switch that
 * is already closed.
 *
 * A gamepad cannot work that way. The Gamepad API has no events for button
 * state; you read the whole device once per frame. So the gamepad necessarily
 * asserts both "pressed" and "not pressed" every single frame, and a naive
 * `setInput('left', false)` sixty times a second would stamp on a left arrow
 * the player is holding down on the keyboard.
 *
 * This is the fix, and it is the only place in the port that knows two humans'
 * worth of input can exist at once: each source owns a *set* of names it is
 * currently holding, and the switch is closed if ANY source holds it. Releases
 * only reach the machine when no source holds the name any more, so a source
 * can re-assert its full state as often as it likes for free.
 *
 * Deliberately knows nothing about `Machine`, the DOM, or what a "source" is --
 * it takes a callback and a pair of strings, which is what makes it testable in
 * plain Node.
